# Github-for-beginners

GitHub is a web-based platform that enables developers to create, store, manage, and share their code. It utilizes the Git software, which provides distributed version control, access control, bug tracking, software feature requests, task management, continuous integration, and wikis for every project.

## What is Git ?
Git is simply a free and open source version control system

## But what is Version Control ? 
Version control, also known as revision control, source control, or source code management, is a software engineering practice that tracks and manages changes to digital assets, such as code, files, and documents, over time. It maintains a record of every modification, including authorship, timestamp, and other details, and aids in managing changes throughout the software development lifecycle.

### Terms to note in Version Control 
- Directory -> Folder
- Terminal or Command Line -> Interface for Text Commands
- CLI -> Command Line Interface
- cd -> Change Directory
- Code Editor -> Word Processor for Writing code
- Repository -> Project, or the folder/place where your project is kept.
- Github(here) -> A website to host your repositories online.

### Git Commands 
- Clone -> Bring a repository that is hosted somewhere like Github into a folder on your local machine
