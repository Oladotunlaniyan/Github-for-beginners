# GitHub for Beginners

GitHub is a web-based collaboration platform that serves as the world's largest community of developers. It enables developers to create, store, manage, and share their code. Think of it like a social network for programmers, where instead of sharing photos and status updates, they share code.

## What is Git?

Git is a free and open-source version control system designed to handle projects of any size with speed and efficiency. Created by Linus Torvalds (who also created Linux), Git helps track changes in code during software development.

## What is Version Control?

Version control is like a "time machine" for your code. It's a system that records changes to files over time, allowing you to:
- Track every change made to your code
- See who made specific changes and when
- Revert to previous versions if something goes wrong
- Work on different versions of the same project simultaneously
- Collaborate with others without overwriting each other's work
